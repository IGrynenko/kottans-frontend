This is a repository for the Kottans' frontend course
## Git and GitHub
### Version Control with Git
1. I learned a couple of amazing things such as
   - how to view the history of commits especially when you've got to see the affected files
   - basic commands for the Vim editor
   - how to exit from the 'git log' command.
2. The fact that deleted commits can be restored within 30 days.
3. 'commit --amend' and 'reser', I make mistakes very often :smile:

2. The way how useful the commands 'find' and 'grep' are.
3. Definetely, the one I'll be using is 'grep', especially when we need to find certain changes in commits.

### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1
1. All types of headers.
2. The fact that 'never expires' in the Expires header is just a one-year shift.
3. Pay attention to the status codes and react correspondedly once received particular ones, and have a correct structure of the headers.
### HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2
1. The difference between http 1.0 vs http 1.1. Also, what parallel connections and persistent connections are.
2. That document expiration (max-age) is set in seconds and taht there are lots of different things you can do with cashing.
3. Identification, Authentication and Cache.
