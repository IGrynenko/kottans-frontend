## Git and GitHub
### Version Control with Git
1. I learned a couple of amazing things such as
   - how to view the history of commits especially when you've got to see the affected files
   - basic commands for the Vim editor
   - how to exit from the 'git log' command.
2. The fact that deleted commits can be restored within 30 days.
3. 'commit --amend' and 'reser', I make mistakes very often :smile:
